Bug: Instead of displaying the correct mask values, the test function pic_test prints straight 0s from MASTER_8259_PORT and SLAVE_8259_PORT.
Solution: Instead of using inb() to output values from PORT, we should output MASTER/SLAVE_8259_DATA which contain the mask values.

Bug: While using printf() in test.c to output test result or desired variables, some times, the printed staff appears on top of the screen rather than the buttom. Also, the first character of the printed string is replaced by some other random characters.
Cause: putc() use screen_y to store the y postion of the character to be displayed on the console. screen_y increment when meets '\n' or '\r'. Then if it is already the bottom, screen_y just exceed the screen and the character appears on the top.
Solution: Added support for line feed in putc.

Files: idt.c
Bug: After issusing an exception in test file, the system immediately crash and hence reboot repeatedly.
Solution: The "present" field of each component in IDT is set to 0, as a result, processor did not jump to the desired position after reaching this line, causing the system to crash. The bug is solved by setting "present" field of each meaningful entry to 1.

Files: paging.h
Bug: When the system boot and before it run the test, it will stuck and then kill itself, gdb would say as watchdog expired.
Solution: via breakpoint setting, the stuff happend at the code envoke the inline assembly hardware setting. Checking it, we realize that the inilization order may matter, before everything settled, it should not start page mode, or modify something after it set.

Files: i8259.c
Bug: After enabling PIC #8, rtc test_interrupts does not work, but if all PICs #0-15 are enabled, the test works as expected.
Solution: While initializing i8259 PIC, also enable #2 which enables the slave PIC.

Files: keyboard.c
Bug: After press the keyboard, a empty space will follow the letter we just typed. 
Solution: Add a range check before we swich the scancode to asccii code to make sure those invalid scancode will not be interpreted as a empty space.

Files: rtc.c
Bug: The rtc interrupt only happen once. 
Solution: set the register c for rtc in the end of each rtc interupt to make sure the interupt can happen next time.

Files: lib.c
Bug: The last character of a line will not be displayed since it directly goes to the next line.
Solution: In putc() changing new line without line feed, add one situation which displays the most recent input character.

Files: terminal.c
Bug: the terminal read function does not compile for NULL pointer transfer.
Solution: use a intermediate temp buffer to convert the pointer into int8_t * pointer, so that they are compatible.

Files: file_sys.c
Bug: content in buffer returned by read function dose not match content in the file 
Solution: afterwards we find that not only data blocks, bt also inode blocks does not locate continuously in memory, so we cannot make this assumption.

Bug: the frequency is inversed
reason: for formular to compute rate is wrong, the correct version is frequency =  32768 >> (rate-1).

Files: sys_call.c
Bug: page fault when execute system call
Reason: the way using pointer is unsafe, for kernel stuff, must allocate the space for varible, 
        rather than an uninitialized pointer, which may in the unallowed page region 

Contributer: Fengqing Jiang
Files: sys_call.c
Bug: if input extra space at the end of the args, it will fail to execute
Reason: _parse_cmd_ did not handle the args correctly,since use wrong end function to handle space at end of the args

Contributer: Fengqing Jiang
Files: sys_call.c
Bug: it could not execute any sub-program in shell, and Page Fault
Reason: the shortcut calculate function was incorrect with bracketsï¼Œ then it leads to strange address, then Page Fault

Contributer: Fengqing Jiang
Files: sys_call.c
Bug: when test nested shell to 6 level shell, and go to 7th shell, it will fail but also return no such file.
Reason: the return value should be different from simple fail (-1), otherwise would be regard as no such file by the shell program.
 
Contributer: Nachuan Wang
Date: April 11 2021
Files: sys_call.c
Bug: after shell is excuted, the prompt cannot respond to any key press
Reason: system call is set to be an interrupt gate, so before entering to actual fucntions we need to first restore the IF 
        in EFLAGE register, otherwise all interrupt (like key press) will be suppressed.

Files: sys_call.c
Bug: read file "." does not fill the buffer with any character
Reason: when initializing file operation jump table, we use a "switch", however, we hadn't realized that C will continue to 
        excute remaining switch cases after finishing the first case. Consequently, the jump table is initialized in a wrong 
        way. After adding "break" at each case the error is fixed.

Contributer: Nachuan Wang
Date: April 12 2021
Files: sys_call.c
Bug: after an exception is issued, "shell" does not print any information
Reason: at the end of "excute" system call, just after code jumping from "halt", we use a "return success" to return, wh
        ich will rewrite the return value in EAX. Therefore, we use a variable to store the value in EAX in assembly code and 
        return it instead.

==================================================
===================== Checkpoint 4 ====================

Contributer: Bo Pan
Date: April 17 2021
Files: sys_call.c
Bug: when running "grep", the function did not stop
Reason: in "open" function, we did not call specific type of open function for each file. Normally it has no effect on other 
        program since most open just return 0 and do nothing. An exception is that rtc_open will initialize the frequency of 
        rtc, so if we do not initialize it at open time, calling read_rtc may cause the function to fall into infinit loops.

Files: page.c
Bug: page fault when running fish
Reason: forget to set the DPL in page dictionary to 3

Contributer: Bo Pan
Date: April 17 2021
Files: rtc.c
Bug: in infinite while loop after the first frame of fish is added
Reason: did not set the counter of virtualized rtc to MAX_FREQ when we start a new rtc_read. If we swich freqecent (using write), 
this may cause our counter never reach 0.
