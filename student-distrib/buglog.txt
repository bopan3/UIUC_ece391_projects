Bug: Instead of displaying the correct mask values, the test function pic_test prints straight 0s from MASTER_8259_PORT and SLAVE_8259_PORT.
Solution: Instead of using inb() to output values from PORT, we should output MASTER/SLAVE_8259_DATA which contain the mask values.

Bug: While using printf() in test.c to output test result or desired variables, some times, the printed staff appears on top of the screen rather than the buttom. Also, the first character of the printed string is replaced by some other random characters.
Cause: putc() use screen_y to store the y postion of the character to be displayed on the console. screen_y increment when meets '\n' or '\r'. Then if it is already the bottom, screen_y just exceed the screen and the character appears on the top.
Solution: Added support for line feed in putc.

Bug: After issusing an exception in test file, the system immediately crash and hence reboot repeatedly.
Solution: The "present" field of each component in IDT is set to 0, as a result, processor did not jump to the desired position after reaching this line, causing the system to crash. The bug is solved by setting "present" field of each meaningful entry to 1.

Bug: When the system boot and before it run the test, it will stuck and then kill itself, gdb would say as watchdog expired.
Solution: via breakpoint setting, the stuff happend at the code envoke the inline assembly hardware setting. Checking it, we realize that the inilization order may matter, before everything settled, it should not start page mode, or modify something after it set.

Files: i8259.c
Bug: After enabling PIC #8, rtc test_interrupts does not work, but if all PICs #0-15 are enabled, the test works as expected.
Solution: While initializing i8259 PIC, also enable #2 which enables the slave PIC.

Files: keyboard.c
Bug: After press the keyboard, a empty space will follow the letter we just typed. 
Solution: Add a range check before we swich the scancode to asccii code to make sure those invalid scancode will not be interpreted as a empty space.

Files: rtc.c
Bug: The rtc interrupt only happen once. 
Solution: set the register c for rtc in the end of each rtc interupt to make sure the interupt can happen next time.

Bug: The last character of a line will not be displayed since it directly goes to the next line.
Solution: In putc() changing new line without line feed, add one situation which displays the most recent input character.

Files: terminal.c
Bug: the terminal read function does not compile for NULL pointer transfer.
Solution: use a intermediate temp buffer to convert the pointer into int8_t * pointer, so that they are compatible.

Files: file_sys.c
Bug: content in buffer returned by read function dose not match content in the file 
Solution: afterwards we find that not only data blocks, bt also inode blocks does not locate continuously in memory, so we cannot make this assumption.

Bug: the frequency is inversed
reason: for formular to compute rate is wrong, the correct version is frequency =  32768 >> (rate-1).
