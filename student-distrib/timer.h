I/O port     Usage
0x40         Channel 0 data port (read/write)
0x43         Mode/Command register (write only, a read is ignored)

Mode/Command register at I/O address 0x43 
Bits         Usage
6 and 7      Select channel :
                0 0 = Channel 0
                0 1 = Channel 1
                1 0 = Channel 2
                1 1 = Read-back command (8254 only)
4 and 5      Access mode :
                0 0 = Latch count value command
                0 1 = Access mode: lobyte only
                1 0 = Access mode: hibyte only
                1 1 = Access mode: lobyte/hibyte
1 to 3       Operating mode :
                0 0 0 = Mode 0 (interrupt on terminal count)
                0 0 1 = Mode 1 (hardware re-triggerable one-shot)
                0 1 0 = Mode 2 (rate generator)
                0 1 1 = Mode 3 (square wave generator)
                1 0 0 = Mode 4 (software triggered strobe)
                1 0 1 = Mode 5 (hardware triggered strobe)
                1 1 0 = Mode 2 (rate generator, same as 010b)
                1 1 1 = Mode 3 (square wave generator, same as 011b)
0            BCD/Binary mode: 0 = 16-bit binary, 1 = four-digit BCD
